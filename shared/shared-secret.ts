// startup into ~/.agent-peers-secret with file mode 0600; every client
// (cli.ts, MCP servers) reads it and passes it in the X-Agent-Peers-Secret
// header on every broker request. Without it, an arbitrary local process
// could enumerate peers or inject messages by just connecting to localhost.

 *
 * If any check fails, throw a clear error. Fail-closed is intentional: a
 * mode-weakened file means another local user could have read it.
 *
 * Exported so the broker side can apply the identical check to an existing
