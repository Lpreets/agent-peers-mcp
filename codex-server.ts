// codex-server.ts
// MCP stdio server for Codex CLI. Registers as peer_type="codex".
//
// DELIVERY PIPELINE — two layers with a strict division of labor, driven
// by one invariant: no message is acked to the broker (nor pruned from
// the durable queue) until we have evidence the previous tool-response
// cycle actually completed. That evidence is "Codex called us again."
//
//   Layer 1 — Durable on-disk inbox at ~/.agent-peers-codex/<peer-id>.json
//   ------------------------------------------------------------------
//   Background poll (POLL_INTERVAL_MS) writes newly-leased messages here.
//   This is the authoritative persistence layer: messages survive MCP
//   restart within the 60s reclaim window, and nothing gets pruned until
//   we're sure the model actually saw it. File perms hardened to 0o600
//   (dir 0o700) to match the broker's DB trust boundary (see
//   broker.ts enforceDbFilePerms).
//
//   Layer 2 — Authoritative piggyback [PEER INBOX] on tool call
//   ------------------------------------------------------------------
//   withPiggyback is the ONLY path that surfaces message CONTENT + reply
//   cues to the model. It reads (not consumes) from the durable queue,
//   filters out messages already confirmed delivered, and prepends what's
//   left as a [PEER INBOX] block in the tool response.
//
//   Signal-only preview push (notifications/message)
//   ------------------------------------------------------------------
//   A best-effort MCP log notification fires after each background poll
//   that landed new messages in the queue. It carries ONLY the sender's
//   name + peer_type and a pointer to the next tool call — no body, no
//   reply_action. This gives recent Codex CLI versions a "new message
//   from X arrived, look at your inbox" signal in the live transcript
//   without duplicating the authoritative delivery. It does NOT update
//   any dedupe state — the [PEER INBOX] block (Layer 2) is the one and
//   only "this was shown to the model" trigger.
//
// DEDUPE STATE MACHINE (two sets, confirm-on-next-call):
//
//   - `presentedPendingConfirm` — message_ids included in the CURRENT
//     tool response's [PEER INBOX] block but not yet known-delivered.
//     Populated inside withPiggyback just before return.
//
//   - `seen` — message_ids we're SURE reached the model. Populated at
//     the START of the NEXT tool call (Codex calling us again is the
//     evidence that the previous response cycle landed). Once a message
//     is `seen`, we ack its lease, prune it from the durable queue, and
//     ignore any future re-delivery of the same id.
//
// This splits what was previously a single `seen` set that conflated
// "about to be shown" with "known shown." The earlier code could ack +
// prune a message whose response was aborted before reaching Codex —
// silent loss. The split closes that race: a dropped response leaves the
// message in the durable queue AND outside the `seen` set, so on the
// next tool call (or the next session after a restart) it re-surfaces.
// At-least-once per spec §5.4.
//
// Shutdown: clear timers and exit. Deliberately do NOT flush pendingAcks
// (those messages may not have reached Codex yet — flushing on exit would
// be silent loss). Deliberately do NOT unregister (preserves
// reclaim-by-name). Durable queue stays on disk so a restart within the
// 60s reclaim window picks up exactly where this session left off.

DELIVERY ON THIS SIDE (Codex) — READ CAREFULLY, THIS IS LOAD-BEARING:

The current Codex CLI does NOT surface mid-task MCP push notifications
to the model. That means you do not see peer messages the instant they
arrive — you only see them when YOU call an agent-peers tool. A peer
can send you a DM at 10:00; if you don't touch agent-peers until 10:20,
you won't know about it until 10:20. This is a hard constraint of the
Codex runtime, not a bug in this server.

RULE: Call \`check_messages\` as the FIRST thing you do every time the
user sends you a message. It is one cheap tool call. It surfaces any
pending peer inbox as a \`[PEER INBOX]\` block prepended to the
response. Without this habit, peer messages pile up for minutes or
hours before you notice them — and the "colleague" experience
collapses into "broken chat."

Exceptions: you do NOT need to call \`check_messages\` before:
  - calling another agent-peers tool in the same turn (they all surface
    the inbox too — \`list_peers\`, \`send_message\`, \`set_summary\`,
    and \`rename_peer\` all prepend \`[PEER INBOX]\` if there is one)
  - running a long sequence of file-editing / shell tools where you
    have no reason to expect a peer interaction. Even then, call
    \`check_messages\` again at the start of the next user turn.

DELIVERY CHANNELS:

  1. \`[PEER INBOX]\` block prepended to ANY agent-peers tool response.
     This is the AUTHORITATIVE delivery — full message body, sender
     identity, reply instructions. When you see it, apply the REACTIVE
     rules above.

  2. A best-effort MCP \`notifications/message\` log push also fires
     on each background poll tick, but current Codex CLI does not
     expose these to the model. Treat the [PEER INBOX] block as your
     only input. Path (2) is future-compatible plumbing.`,
